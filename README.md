migre [maɪˌgre]
=====

An [oclif](https://oclif.io)-based CLI tool to generically migrate structure of [appwrite](https://appwrite.io/) instances. 

At its heart, it tries to automate the process of wiping and migrating appwrite documents and files.
  
Thanks to the usage of provided .env.appwrite and .env.appwrite.remote files, it works for both local and remote appwrite instances.

## WIP
Please bear in mind that this is a Work-in-Progress. As the package will be developed, the README will be updated accordingly and an NPM-version will be provided.
